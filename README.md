# Salutations!

## A Peek into My World

I'm someone who derives joy from the realm of programming, whether it's GoLang, Node.js, or Python. When I'm not immersed in code, you'll likely find me nestled at home, appreciating the tranquility of rainy days in IN. Oh, and did I mention I'm a big fan of NVim? 🖥️

## My Current Focus

At the moment, I'm delving into the realms of backend and network engineering.

## My Essence

🐼 I'm all about taking it easy, writing some code, maybe geeking out over Linux kernel patches, and simply enjoying life with a cup of tea. 🍵
